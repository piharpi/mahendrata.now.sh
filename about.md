Hello peps, I'm student of computer science from Banyuwangi, living in Yogyakarta. This blog for documentation about my programming ðŸŽ’ journey in Bahasa, running on jekyll, hosting on netlify and using [bangsring](http://github.com/piharpi/bangsring) simple theme.

Working using Ruby, Javascript and doing fun with HTML CSS, my main framework now is Ruby on Rails, also willingness to learn another web technology, so if you have a question about me or else, just letter on me.

You can **[report](https://github.com/piharpi/me/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)** if there is an broken link(s) or somethings else.

_Regardless, Harpi_
