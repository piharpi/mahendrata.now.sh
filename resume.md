### Biography
I am a student of the [Amikom University Informatics](http://informatika.amikom.ac.id/) program, and to be a professional software engineer, specializing in web technologies. I am most well-known 

You can usually find me coffee in-hand, humming my latest gospel favourite. If I’m not coding, I’m probably out on a long run, taking a photo of something pretty, or enjoying a delicious German beer.

### Education
##### Amikom University
_Sleman, Yogyakarta — Informatics ‘18_

After graduate from SMK Negeri 1 Banyuwangi, I studying at Amikom University Yogyakarta, started tranform php to ruby and learning new things, become a normal people and get out from my gaming activity.

##### SMK Negeri 1 Banyuwangi

Love, but my class ~nice, in there I was started learn about Algorithm, HTML5, CSS5, PHP and Javascript programming, I have owed to my teachers, because of that I know programming.

__Activity:__ LKS 2017 Tingkat Provinsi.

### Skills
As I said, I write software. I write in __Go, UNIX/GNU via Bash, JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS__ daily, and store it all in git. I’m proficient in a bunch of other languages and love to learn new ones, but I don’t use them regularly. I learned how to program using Java and PHP, so I would say I know them fairly well.

Jekyll and Goji (a Go library) are my two favourite tools for website creation. My static sites are tossed behind nginx, because I believe in good memory practices.

I’m concise, task-oriented, and am a lover of IRC/IM for communicating with team members. I’m a big believer in __asynchronous communication__ for discussion and code review beyond initial planning stages. I like a good challenge.
